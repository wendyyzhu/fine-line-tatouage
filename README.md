# Fine-Line-Tatouage
### PROJECT 2 - Building a full-stack CRUD application 
As part of General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course, our second project was to build our first full-stack application using Node/Express/Postgres. 

The requirements was for the app to have full-CRUD data operations and for certain or all routes to be password protected via session authentication. Data is stored in PostgreSQL.
